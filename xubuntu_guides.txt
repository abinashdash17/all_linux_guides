I don't understand how this xubuntu is working so swiftly. No lag... whats happening. may be after some software installtion or update it will start lagging. let's test.

changes made:
moved xterm to xterm.bak
softlink xterm to xfce4-terminal.wrapper
so that vim opens in xfce4-terminal by default-->> working fine
redshift
added the following:
/etc/pulse/default.pa

load-module module-udev-detect tsched=0

alsa guide:
Setting the default device
Jump to: navigation, search

Find your desired card with:

   cat /proc/asound/cards

and then create /etc/asound.conf with following:

   defaults.pcm.card 1
   defaults.ctl.card 1

Replace "1" with number of your card determined above.

reinstalled pulseaudio cause I can't get alsa to work
It' didn't fix the problem of occasional lag.
tried to debug the problem with 'top'
it seems wpa_supplicant periodic scanning is causing the issue. I could rememberubuntu with openbox didn't have this problem(I used wicd back then). arch also didn't have this problem because I used netctl which didn't do periodic scans. Looks like others also hav ethe sam problem(https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2163994). Findind a way to fix this.
disable wifi from nm menu(that simple?) testing...
no lag till now... may be the problem is fixed..
